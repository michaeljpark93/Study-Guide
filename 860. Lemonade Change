# At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. 
# Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).
# Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

# Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

# Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

# Example 1:
# Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: [5,5,10]
# Output: true

# Example 3:
# Input: [10,10]
# Output: false

# Example 4:
# Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
# Output: false

# Note:
# 0 <= bills.length <= 10000
# bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.

# @param {Integer[]} bills
# @return {Boolean}
