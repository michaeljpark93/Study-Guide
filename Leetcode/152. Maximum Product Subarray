# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

# Example 1:
# Input: [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

# Example 2:
# Input: [-2,0,-1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = largest = smallest = nums[0]
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums[1:]):
            largest, smallest = max(num, num*largest, num*smallest), min(num, num*largest, num*smallest)
            result = max(result, largest)
        return result
