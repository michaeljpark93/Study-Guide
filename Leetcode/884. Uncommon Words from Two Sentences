# We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

# A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

# Return a list of all uncommon words. 

# You may return the list in any order.

# @param {String} a
# @param {String} b
# @return {String[]}
