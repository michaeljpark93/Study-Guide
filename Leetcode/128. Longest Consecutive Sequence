# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

# Example:

# Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer}
def longest_consecutive(nums)
    return 0 if nums.empty?
    set = Set.new
    longest = 1
    nums.each { |n| set.add(n) }
    
    nums.each do |num|
        next unless set.include?(num + 1)
        count = 1
        while set.include?(num + count)
            count += 1
        end
        if count > longest
            longest = count
        end
    end
    
    longest
end
