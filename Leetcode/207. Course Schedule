// There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses ?

//   Example 1:
// Input: 2, [[1, 0]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

//   Example 2:
// Input: 2, [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
// To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
// also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

//   Note:
// The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices.Read more about how a graph is represented.
// You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
